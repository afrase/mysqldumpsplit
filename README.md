# Install

If you are on a Mac you can install with Homebrew.

`brew install afrase/tap/mysqldumpsplit`

You could also grab the binary from the releases page.

# Performance

Using a sort of pipelined approach, mysqldumpsplit is very memory efficient.
The amount of memory used will mostly be based on how large each line in the file is.

I was able to split a **130 table 16GB** sql file in less than **30 seconds** and use less than **20MB of RAM**.

# Usage

Split a SQL dump into individual tables.

`./mysqldumpsplit -i ~/Downloads/dump.sql -o ~/Downloads/output`

Skip the data for specific tables.

`./mysqldumpsplit -i ~/Downloads/dump.sql -o ~/Downloads/output -skipData table1,table2,table3`

Combine all tables back into a single file. Deletes the output directory once finished unless the combined 
file is in the same directory.

`./mysqldumpsplit -i ~/Downloads/dump.sql.gz -o ~/Downloads/output -skipData table1,table2,table3 -combine -combineFile ~/Downloads/dumpfile.sql`

Skip data for all tables.

`./mysqldumpsplit -i ~/Downloads/dump.sql.gz -o ~/Downloads/output -skipData *`

# Know issues
- If everything in the file is on a single line this will not work.
- Even if skipping the data for a table, it still must be read by the program.
